## Description
This application allows the unification and organization of all areas, that is, to be a system that allows the traceability of all processes and, therefore, leads to the planning and optimization of resources. 
<br><br>
Data is storaged in a database hosted on a local server. This database is managed with PostgreSQL. The database diagram can be seen in the following pdf: 
[Database Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16575592/ESQUEMA.BASE.DE.DATOS.pdf)
<br><br>
Since the user system is role-based, each user has access to a specific part of the application, which means that they only have access to certain functionalities specific to their position. A diagram of the application for each type of role can be seen here:
